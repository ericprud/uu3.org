- Semantic Web
  - assertions (e.g. Turtle, Trig, RDF/XML...)
  - inference (RDFS, OWL)
  - query (SPARQL)
  - schema (ShEx and SHACL)

- Assertions
  - triples of (subject predicate object)
  - leverage Web Architecture for disambiguation
    - a term is a URL. when you invent the term,
      define it at that that URL
    - prevents different definitions for same term
      !eliminates need for disambiguation!
  - leverage social structures and search
    - I want to say "protein X is a product of gene Y."
    - do a search before inventing a term
    - re-use Gene Ontology geneProductOf
      !minimizes diffusion!

- Ontologies
  - RDFS defines groups of properties and classes
    - if a cat has a child, it has type kitten
  - OWL defines:
    - constraints
      Person subClassOf
        onProperty geneticParent 2
        onProperty mitocondrialParent 0-1
    - type inference
      if you have X1 and X2, let's call you a X
    - open world
    - no unique name assumption (UNA)
  - usually conceptual

- Web Protocols / Data Structures
  - reuse terms from multiple ontologies
  - queried with closed world and UNA

- Schemas
  - reflect data usage (closed world, UNA)
  - validation
    - description
      - consensus detection
  - usually record-based

- ShEx
  - expressive ("regular" language)
  - cardinalities
  - groups
    `(:givenName . ; :familyName .) | :name`
  - boolean combinations `(<Person> AND NOT <Customer>) OR <Manager>`
  - repeated properties
    `:component { :code ["systolic"]; :value xsd:decimal }
     :component { :code ["diastolic"]; :value xsd:decimal }
  - extensible without modification
