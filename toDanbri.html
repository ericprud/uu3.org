As I understand my mandate, I am to say a few words about the bride and groom and how they met, and in the process, lay bare the groom's tragic flaws for us all to mock.
I believe we are brought together today by standards, which is when a few people get to tell a bunch of people what to do.
More specifically, "we", meaning Danbri, Hadley and I, were brought together by Web standards.
Just so you know, Danbri is Dan Brickley; some of you may have heard of him.
In the web standards community, Dan is known as Danbri.
Hadley appears to use her birthname, which makes this story simpler.
</p>
<p>
Back to Web standards, as I know that's what we all excited to discuss.
Web standards come in three specialties.
The easiest to describe are the "painters".
They care about look and feel.
They color-match paint chips, minimize cognitive burden, and harmonize the Web in general.
We exploit these people without contributing to their cause.
</p>
<p>
The next are the "electricians".
They make sure that everything a computer can do, a browswer can do.
If your computer can dazzle you and suck up your time with dizzying frame-rates, your browser can too.
If your computer can theoretically be used to mine BitCoin for maleficent actors, your browswer can help connect them to you.
"Electricians" make sure that every move you make is recorded in distributed ledgers owned by corporate interestes.
When you die, they could continue your life in a simulation.
But you wouldn't buy anything so they won't.
</p>
<p>
But the specialty that we care about today are the pedants who care about the precise meaning of every single idea and how they fit together.
They build networks of information that conduct implications and intention around in that intricate network that Ted Stevens (no, not Al Gore), described as a "series of tubes".
These are, of course, the plumbers.
Danbri and I are typical plumbers.
Hadley has much more polish than your averge plumber.
Her poise and charisma allow her to convince others to do the work that Danbri or I would intend to finish *some day*.
But her accomplishments in government and health care data land her squarely in the plumber camp with us.

You may think that a person so devoted to linguistic precision would be insufferably exacting in their daily life.
I speak of the sort of person who purchases insurance, does their taxes, and pays their bills when they can, vs when they must.
Sadly, it is probably better to imagine a plumber as someone who likes cutting, threading and sweating pipes, digging holes, crawling into holes, wrangling human waste...
Anything so long as it isn't billing, filing expenses, or anything else adminstrative.
When I say that Danbri and I do paperwork when we must, I mean *must*, under threat of eviction, imprisonment, or ostracism.

How would Web standards bring people together, apart from some in righteous rebellion?
It was more the process of standardization; the actual standards themselves are irrelevant.
This process involves lots of email, chat, teleconferences, and modern whatnot.
The virtual aspect of our interactions meant that "closeness" was more measure of overlapping topics and schedules than social proximity.
When times were good, we'd have several meetings per year distributed about the globe in cities that reasonable people would genuinely want to go to.
There, we'd typically shove as many people as possible into a famiglia in Tuscany or a boatel on the Danube.
In leaner times, we'd spend sweaty nights on each others' nagahyde couches for weeks at a time, eating rice and beans and generally living from uncashed paycheck to uncashed paycheck.
</p>
<p>
We come from a fairly intimate group.
We'd park on each others' couches, date each others' roommates, and eventually become each others' roommates.
Those of us with coincident pathologies would provide late-night emotional support for one another, easing the trauma of arranging last-minute travel or searching for a long-neglected checkbook.
</p>
<p>
Over decades of couch-surfing or living together, Danbri and I accumulated our respective crushing burdens of half-finished projects, unbilled expenses, stacks of hard drives that might have something we need.
Our world is a sea of unclosed browser tabs.
I see no reformation on either of our parts, and expect our guilt to mount ever higher until wiped clean by the sweet release of death.
</p>
<p>
On that cheery note, Hadley, I present you Danbri, well-meaning but irredeemable, brilliant and distracted, artistic in his deadpan humor, and a lovely person to live with, which I expect you will to continue to do.
Danbri, I present you Hadley, who is comparitively high-functioning, but lovely none-the-less.
She knows not only what a calendar is and how to use it, but even where hers is!
I hope that either Danbri picks up this skill by osmosis or that Hadley re-plumbs her metabolic pathways to oxidize adrenalyn and cortisone, as we do.
Even now, we may learn from each other the subtle arts associated with adulthood.
</p>
<p>
One last point: there's a series of physical tubes connecting England to France; so I expect some surfers on my couch!
